		title: 'Can I combine the Australian Pink Clay with other products?',
		content: '<p>Our Sand & Sky products are designed to slot easily into any skincare routine, for a taste of holiday skin. While all of our products can be used together, our products are highly active, so there are a few guidelines to follow to ensure you\'re not having too much of a good thing.</p><br /><p>Because of the particularly active nature of our Australian Pink Clay Mask, we recommend not combining it with other active ingredients on the same day. This gives your skin a rest on the actives, and time to realise the amazing results of our multi-tasking formulas. You should not exfoliate with our products more than 3 times a week. That means, if using our Australian Pink Clay Flash Perfection Exfoliator, you can use them up to 3 times a week. Avoid using our Australian Pink Clay Porefining Face Mask or Deep Pore Cleanser on the same day as the Flash Perfection Exfoliating Treatment.</p>',
